# Data Quality Evaluation – Adult Dataset

This repository evaluates **data quality metrics** on the [UCI Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) using three widely used frameworks:  
1. **Ydata-Profiling**  
2. **Amazon PyDeequ**  
3. **Great Expectations**  

The goal is to explore, assess, and compare different approaches to data profiling and validation, and to derive relevant data quality metrics.
